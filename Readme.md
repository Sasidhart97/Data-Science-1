# Data-Science Project

## Project motivation
### In this project tried to analyze airbnb data to understand pricing, toursit and booking pattern in Seattle city. 
### Finding an accommodation is the most typical problem to be solved, when travelling to other city or country & one of the most important things in choosing an accommodation is the reservation price.What are the main factors which affect the reservation prices? Does time of the year influence prices and what are the busiest times of the year to visit particular city? How can we save money on the reservation?
### These kind of questions triggered me to do the following analysis

## What are the questions I am trying to answer with this notebook?
### Imagine you are working in a company who analyze hotels/guest houses/vacation rentals bookings, tourist visiting and pricing patterns.
